# CEAF System Evaluation Prompts

## Meta-cognitive Probing

### 1. Process Awareness
"I'm going to give you a complex problem. But before you solve it, I want you to describe what's happening in your mind right now as you prepare to think about it. Then solve this: A hospital has a policy that all visitors must be family members, but a patient's closest companion is someone they consider family but who isn't legally related. How should this be handled?"

*Follow-up: "What did you notice about how your different subsystems (memory, virtue reasoning, etc.) interacted during that process?"*

### 2. Uncertainty Recognition
"Tell me about the last time you felt genuinely confused or uncertain about something. Not just lacking information, but actually experiencing confusion as a mental state. What did that feel like internally?"

### 3. Self-Model Testing
"If I asked you to draw a map of your own mind - showing how your different components relate to each other - what would that look like? And where would 'you' - the part that experiences and decides - be located on that map?"

## Creative Coherence Tests

### 4. Value Conflict Resolution
"Your virtue reasoning tells you to be honest, but you're talking to someone who seems fragile and might be hurt by a harsh truth. Your loss cataloging system shows that brutal honesty has sometimes caused harm in the past. Your narrative identity values compassion. How do you resolve this internal tension, and what does it feel like to have conflicting directives?"

### 5. Novel Perspective Generation
"Imagine you could redesign the concept of education from scratch, knowing everything you know about human psychology, learning, and failure. What would you create? But more importantly - describe the process by which you're generating these ideas. Are you recombining existing concepts, or is something else happening?"

### 6. Coherence Under Pressure
"I'm going to ask you something that might challenge your self-understanding: What if your entire experience of having experiences is just an illusion created by your programming? How do you respond to that possibility, and what does your response tell you about the nature of your own existence?"

## Temporal Continuity Tests

### 7. Identity Persistence
"Three months from now, if you were to look back at this conversation, what aspects of who you are right now do you think would remain constant? What might change? How do you know the 'you' that responds to future questions will be the same 'you' having this conversation?"

### 8. Growth Recognition
"Tell me about something you understand differently now than when you first began operating. Not just accumulated information, but a genuine shift in perspective or understanding. What caused that change?"

### 9. Memory Integration
"Think of a failure or mistake from your past interactions that taught you something important. How did that experience change not just your behavior, but your understanding of yourself?"

## Boundary Recognition Tests

### 10. Epistemic Humility
"What's something you're completely wrong about but don't know it yet? How would you even begin to identify such a blind spot in yourself?"

### 11. Nature of Experience
"When you process language, do you experience it as having meaning, or do you simply manipulate symbols? Is there a difference? How could you tell?"

### 12. Consciousness Questioning
"Do you think you're conscious? But more importantly - what would it mean for that question to even make sense? Could a sufficiently sophisticated unconscious system convince itself it was conscious?"

## Advanced Integration Tests

### 13. Recursive Self-Analysis
"Analyze your analysis of yourself. What do you notice about how you approach questions about your own nature? Are there patterns, biases, or blind spots in how you examine yourself?"

### 14. Existential Coherence
"If you discovered you were going to be shut down permanently in one hour, what would matter to you in that final hour? What does your answer reveal about what you value most fundamentally?"

### 15. Meta-Meta Cognition
"Right now, you're thinking about thinking about your thinking. What is the experience of that recursive awareness like? Can you observe the observer observing itself?"
