Ive been building this for months now, my intention was to create Agents that have substance. But ive realized that i dont have enough funding to maybe make it into a viable product. So im releasing it in hopes other people can find it and help them with their Agents creation. 

**Aura AI Agents** is a powerful, flexible, and scalable framework for building, managing, and interacting with advanced conversational AI agents. Built on Python with FastAPI, it provides a robust foundation for creating multi-tenant AI experiences, where each agent operates in an isolated environment with its own memory system, personality, and capabilities.

The framework is built around two distinct and powerful agent architectures: **NCF (Narrative Context Framing)** and the cutting-edge experimental **CEAF (Coherent Emergence Agent Framework)**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual Agent Architectures:**
  - **NCF (Narrative Context Framing):** A robust, production-ready system that uses sophisticated prompt engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and a reflection loop to create agents with deep context and personality.
  - **CEAF (Coherent Emergence Agent Framework):** An experimental autonomous agent architecture that utilizes a metacognitive control loop (MCL) and an adaptive memory architecture (AMA) to develop a coherent, emergent identity over time.

- **Advanced Memory Systems:**
  - **MemoryBlossom:** An isolated memory system for each NCF agent, featuring distinct memory types, salience decay, and emotional scores.
  - **Adaptive RAG:** An optional layer over MemoryBlossom that adds adaptive concept clustering and domain specialization for even smarter memory retrieval.
  - **AMA (Adaptive Memory Architecture):** The core of the CEAF system, which autonomously organizes experiences into concept clusters.

- **Multi-Tenant & User-Isolated:** The architecture is designed from the ground up to serve multiple users, ensuring each agent's data, memories, and files remain completely isolated and secure.

- **Extensible Specialist Agents:** Offload complex tasks to dedicated specialist agents. The system includes out-of-the-box examples for image generation (Tensor.Art) and speech processing (Hugging Face).

- **Comprehensive REST API:** A robust API built with FastAPI provides endpoints for everything from user authentication (JWT) and agent management to chat interaction, memory management, and file uploads.

- **Agent Marketplace & Cloning:** Users can publish their private agents as "public templates" to the marketplace. Other users can then clone these agents, inheriting their foundational personality and memories to kickstart their own experience.

- **Per-Agent Integrated RAG:** Users can upload files (PDFs, TXT) to an agent's personal storage. The agent can then search these documents to answer questions, giving each agent its own custom knowledge base.

- **Live Collective Memory:** An optional shared wisdom system where agents can contribute anonymized insights, allowing other agents to benefit from collective knowledge.

- **Dynamic Credit System:** A built-in billing system that deducts credits based on the LLM model used, with configurable costs for different model tiers.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The AuraCode system is built in layers to ensure modularity and scalability:

1.  **API Layer (FastAPI - `api/routes.py`):** The entry point for all interactions. It handles HTTP requests, user authentication (JWT), and data validation.
2.  **Management Layer (`agent_manager.py`):** The heart of the system. It orchestrates the creation, deletion, and retrieval of agent instances. It decides whether to instantiate an NCF agent or a CEAF adapter.
3.  **Agent Layer (NCF/CEAF Instances):**
    - **NCFAuraAgentInstance:** The standard agent implementation. It utilizes `ncf_processing.py` to build context-rich prompts and interacts with MemoryBlossom.
    - **CEAFAgentAdapter:** An adapter layer that presents the complex CEAF system with a compatible interface, allowing it to be used transparently by the rest of the system.
4.  **Memory Layer (`memory_system/` & `ceaf_system/AMA.py`):** Handles the storage, retrieval, and management of each agent's knowledge. Includes MemoryBlossom, Adaptive RAG, and CEAF's Adaptive Memory Architecture.
5.  **Persistence Layer (SQLAlchemy & Filesystem):**
    - A SQLite database (`aura_agents.db`) stores user and agent metadata.
    - The `agent_storage/` directory contains each agent's configuration, memory, and RAG files in an isolated folder structure.

## üß† Core Concepts: NCF vs. CEAF

| Feature | NCF (Narrative Context Framing) | CEAF (Coherent Emergence Agent Framework) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approach** | Sophisticated Prompt Engineering | Autonomous, Self-Organizing System |
| **Awareness** | Prompt-based; context is provided on each turn. | Emergent; internal state evolves over time. |
| **Components** | `ncf_processing`, `MemoryBlossom`, `AuraReflector` | `AMA`, `MCL`, `ORA`, `NCIM`, `VRE`, `AURA` |
| **Ideal for** | Robust character agents, context-aware assistants. | AGI research, consciousness simulation, agents that learn from failure. |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | High (Experimental) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AuraCode server locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Git

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [ [<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>](https://github.com/IhateCreatingUserNames2/Aura_AI_Agents/new/main)](https://github.com/IhateCreatingUserNames2/Aura_AI_Agents)
    cd AuraCode
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project uses several libraries. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    # NOTE: A requirements.txt file would need to be generated. Based on the code, it would include:
    # fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy python-dotenv litellm bcrypt pyjwt sentence-transformers scikit-learn faiss-cpu langgraph langchain
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your API keys:
    ```env
    # Required for most LLM operations
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."

    # Key for the Image Generation Specialist Agent
    TENSORART_API_KEY="..."
    
    # Key for the Speech Specialist Agent
    HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="..."

    # Secret key for JWT authentication tokens (change to something secure)
    JWT_SECRET_KEY="a-very-long-and-secure-secret-key"
    ```

5.  **Set up the Database:**
    Run the migration script to create and verify the SQLite database schema.
    ```bash
    python db_migration.py
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

With the virtual environment activated and the `.env` file configured, start the API server:

```bash
uvicorn main_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) will be at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
- If the frontend is present in the `frontend/` folder, it will be served at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts & Utilities

The project includes several scripts in the root directory for management and testing:

- `db_migration.py`: Safely applies schema changes to the SQLite database.
- `run_locomo_benchmark.py`: Runs the LoCoMo benchmark on a specific agent to test its long-term memory capabilities.
- `uploader.py`: A CLI tool for bulk-creating agents from JSON "biography" files.
- `wisdom_collector.py`: A process that can be run in the background to index insights from the "Live Collective Memory."
- `check_db_agents.py`: A CLI tool to check the publication status of agents in the database.
